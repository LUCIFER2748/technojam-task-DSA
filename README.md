College Club Audition â€“ Coding Tasks

<h3>Introduction</h3>

Welcome to my college club audition! In this repository, you will find various answers to coding tasks. <br>
I have completed easy and medium level tasks and first two hard levels.


<h4>Easily Performed Tasks</h4>

<h5>Reverse Array or String</h5>
<p>I have developed an array or string reversing program. I simply used string comprhension to do the task.</p>

<h5>Count Pairs with Given Sum</h5>
<p></p>This problem requires finding the number of pairs in an array whose sum is equal to a given integer K. For this i used a simple two pointer approch to find all the pairs.</p>

<h5>Find Missing Number</h5>
<p>The mission was to identify a missing number among the first N integers in an array. For this task i have considered using a summation approch rather than a loop check <br> using the formula of sum of firsst N numbers</p>


<h4>Medium Task</h4>
<h5>Find the factorial of a large number.</h5>
<p>A solution to Find the factorial of a large number. For this Task i was initially going to use a reccursive approch, <br>However that would have been caused overloading for large numbers so i re-considered and used a loop to find the factorial.</p>


<h4>Hard Stuff</h4>
<h5>Prime Numbers in an Interval</h5>
<p>A program for finding prime numbers within a given interval [a,b]. The simplest approch to this accoridng to me was running a loop and checking the primility of each number</p>
<br>
<h5>Reverse Bits of a Number</h5>
<p>Printing the reversed bits of a non-negative integer value. For this task i first convereted the number to base 2 then reversed it using string comprehension and then simply converted it back to base 10 decimal number</p>
<br>

<h3>That was all the Tasks i did in the DSA section one can open each folder and read the usage of each function</h3>
