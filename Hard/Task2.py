# Given a non-negative integer n. The problem is to reverse the bits of n 
# and print the number obtained after reversing the bits. 
# Note that the actual binary representation of the number is being considered for reversing the bits, 
# no leadings 0â€™s are being considered.

# <------------------- Basic Idea --------------------->
# Convert a number in a binary representationa and reverse it using string manipulation then handle zeros
